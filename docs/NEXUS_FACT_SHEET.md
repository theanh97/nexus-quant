## How It Works

```
  ORION (Commander)
    │
    ├── ATLAS (Research) ──▶ Propose new signals & params
    ├── CIPHER (Risk) ────▶ Assess portfolio risk
    ├── ECHO (QA) ────────▶ Validate against overfitting
    ├── FLUX (Ops) ────────▶ Manage experiment queue
    └── SmartRouter ──────▶ Assign best AI model per task

  24/7 Loop:
  run → improve → wisdom → reflect → critique → experiment → handoff
```

## Self-Learning Engine

1. **AI proposes** parameter change
2. **Backtest** on training data
3. **Validate** on holdout (unseen) data
4. **Stress test** with 2x costs
5. **Accept** only if passes ALL gates
6. **Human feedback** stored in memory, influences future R&D
7. **Audit trail** for every decision (append-only ledger)

---

## Anti-Bias Pipeline (5 automated checks)

1. **Look-ahead bias**: No future information leakage
2. **Survivorship bias**: Test for symbol selection bias
3. **Overfitting detection**: IS vs OOS Sharpe comparison
4. **Multiple testing correction**: Bonferroni/BHY adjustment
5. **Sharpe significance**: Statistical t-test (H0: Sharpe=0)
