# Synthetic Data Audit — Crypto Options R1-R48

**Date**: 2026-02-21
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Status**: All research results are on synthetic data. Awaiting real data validation.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

All 48 research studies (R1-R48) in the crypto_options project compute PnL and Sharpe ratios using **synthetic implied volatility (IV) data**. The synthetic IV is generated by an AR(1) mean-reverting model, NOT from real Deribit options market data.

This means:
- **ALL Sharpe numbers are not real-world validated**
- **ALL parameter optimizations may be overfitting to synthetic patterns**
- **NO performance claim can be treated as proven**

## 2. What Data Is Synthetic vs Real

### SYNTHETIC (Generated by AR(1) model)
| Data Field | Generation Method | Location |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| IV ATM | `iv_atm = rv + vrp_synthetic` | deribit_rest.py line ~489 |
| Skew 25d | AR(1) mean-reverting around -5% | deribit_rest.py line ~506 |
| Butterfly 25d | Computed from synthetic put/call IV | deribit_rest.py |
| Term Spread | AR(1) mean-reverting around +2% | deribit_rest.py |

**AR(1) Parameters**: coef=0.90 daily, mean/std calibrated to approximate real crypto IV behavior, seed=42 (deterministic).

### REAL (From Deribit API or computed from real prices)
| Data Field | Source | Trustworthy? |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| BTC/ETH perpetual prices | Deribit REST API | YES |
| Realized Volatility | Computed from log-returns of real prices | YES |
| Historical funding rates | Deribit 2021-2025 | YES |
| Live IV snapshots | Deribit book summary (started 2026-02-21) | YES (but only 2 days) |

## 3. How Synthetic Data Affects PnL

### VRP (Variance Risk Premium) Strategy
```
PnL = 0.5 * (IV² - RV²) * dt
```
- **IV**: SYNTHETIC → VRP PnL magnitude is synthetic
- **RV**: REAL (from prices) → RV component is accurate
- **Impact**: VRP Sharpe is ~50% synthetic-dependent
- **Risk**: Real IV may be more volatile, regime-switching, fatter-tailed

### Skew Mean-Reversion Strategy
```
PnL = weight * d_skew * IV * sqrt(dt) * 2.5
```
- **d_skew**: SYNTHETIC (daily change in synthetic skew) → PnL direction is synthetic
- **IV**: SYNTHETIC → PnL magnitude is synthetic
- **Impact**: Skew Sharpe is ~100% synthetic-dependent
- **Risk**: Real skew is noisier (confirmed: hourly skew tests ALL negative on synthetic)

### Signals (Entry/Exit)
- VRP z-score: uses synthetic IV for VRP calculation → synthetic signal
- Skew z-score: uses synthetic skew series → synthetic signal
- IV percentile: uses synthetic IV distribution → synthetic sizing

## 4. Research Findings Categorized by Confidence

### HIGH CONFIDENCE — Real Value (Not IV-Dependent)

| Research | Finding | Why Real |
|----------|---------|----------|
| R1-R4 | VRP is always-short carry | Carry mechanics principle |
| R7 | 1296 overlays ALL destroy VRP | Time-out-of-market principle |
| R11 | 2-strategy ensemble optimal | Correlation architecture |
| R12 | Static weights > dynamic | Optimization principle |
| R18 | Bidirectional funding model | Uses real funding rates |
| R20 | Ensemble tail protection | Uses real crash prices |
| R21 | 22 regime filters ALL fail | Same as R7 principle |
| R22 | EWMA correlation convergence | Mathematical validation |
| R26 | Equity-curve overlays fail | Same as R7 principle |
| R45 | Cross-strategy gating fails | Independence principle |
| R48 | 29 risk management configs fail | Always-invested principle |

### LOW CONFIDENCE — Needs Real Data

| Research | Finding | Why Uncertain |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| R25 | IV sizing +0.258 Sharpe | IV percentile distribution is synthetic |
| R28 | Optimal sizing 0.5/1.7x | Thresholds from synthetic IV |
| R35 | ETH VRP lookback=60d | May overfit synthetic dynamics |
| R42-R43 | z_entry_short=1.0 | Skew distribution is synthetic |
| R14-R15 | Hourly VRP +75% | Mechanism real, magnitude uncertain |
| ALL | Specific Sharpe numbers | 100% dependent on synthetic IV |

### ZERO CONFIDENCE — Meaningless Without Real Data

| Research | Finding | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| R46-R47 | Per-asset skew fine-tuning | Rejected even on synthetic |
| R45 | Signal interaction dynamics | Synthetic correlation patterns |
| ALL | Exact parameter values | Optimized to synthetic distribution |

## 5. Expected Real Performance

| Metric | Synthetic | Expected Real | Confidence |
|--------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| VRP Sharpe (solo) | 2.088 | 1.5-1.8 | 40% |
| Skew Sharpe (solo) | 1.744 | 1.0-1.3 | 15% |
| Ensemble Sharpe | 4.816 | 1.8-2.2 | 30% |
| MDD | -1.51% | -3% to -8% | 30% |
| Win rate | ~55% | Unknown | 10% |

**Key risk**: Real IV has regime switches, jumps, and fat tails that AR(1) model does NOT capture. This means:
- Drawdowns will be deeper
- Sharpe ratios will be lower
- Some parameters that work on synthetic may fail on real data

## 6. Validation Plan

### Phase 1: 30 days (mid-March 2026)
- Validate VRP signal z-scores with real IV
- Compare real IV percentile distribution vs synthetic
- Check if real skew is more or less noisy than synthetic

### Phase 2: 60 days (late April 2026)
- Full ensemble revalidation with real IV + real skew
- Reoptimize IV-percentile sizing thresholds
- Revalidate asymmetric skew entry/exit thresholds
- Compute real Sharpe ratios

### Phase 3: 1 year (Feb 2027)
- Validate hourly frequency advantage
- Check seasonal effects
- Full parameter reoptimization on real data

## 7. Rules Going Forward

1. **NEVER quote a Sharpe number without saying "on synthetic data"**
2. **NEVER claim parameters are "validated" without real data confirmation**
3. **Architecture decisions ARE trustworthy** (principles don't depend on IV)
4. **Parameter values are NOT trustworthy** (optimized to synthetic distribution)
5. **When real data is available, ALL parameters must be revalidated**
6. **If real performance < 1.0 Sharpe, consider strategy revision**
